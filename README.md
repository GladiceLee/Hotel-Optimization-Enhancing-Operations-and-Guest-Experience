# Optimizing-Operations-and-Customer-Experience-A-Data-Driven-Approach
This report presents a strategic analysis aimed at optimizing hotel operations and enhancing customer experience without increasing staff. Key recommendations include the use of 360-degree tour software to align guest expectations, prioritizing housekeeping schedules to reduce check-in wait times, and implementing an in-house auditing system to minimize housekeeping errors. Detailed calculations, including room occupancy rates and potential revenue gains, support these proposals, offering a data-driven approach to improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in the hospitality industry.
- For Customer Experience Marketing, we proposed implementing 360-degree tour software to align guests' expectations with reality, reducing unnecessary room moves caused by poor booking.
- For Operations, we recommended prioritizing rooms with shorter stays to ensure priority guests have their rooms ready sooner, thus reducing wait times for check-ins and increasing the number of available rooms.
- For Talent Management & HR, we suggested an in-house auditing system to support housekeeping staff, minimizing mistakes and reducing the number of rooms left on leaveover at the end of shifts, which would also lower the need for room moves due to housekeeping errors.
